We will learn various image operations:
    Smoothing
    Blurring
    Morphological Operations
    Grab properties like color spaces and histograms
    
    
History:

Initially colors were represented in RGB format.
However, that is an old format, in the 1970s HSL(Hue, Saturation, Lightness) and HSV(Hue, Saturation, Value) came into play.
They are more closely aligned to the way the human vision actually percieves color.


Blending and Pasting:
If we work with multiple images, opencv allows us to blend those images together and paste images on top of each other

Blending is done via the formula:
new_pixel = alpha * pixel_1 + beta * pixel_2 + gamma.
pixel_1 is the pixel of the first image, pixel_2 is the pixel of the second image

Thresholding:
Simple method of segmenting an image into different parts.
Will convert an image to only consist of two values: white or black



Smoothing:
Helps in getting rid of noise, or helps an application focus on general details

Blurring:
Blur Kernel:
Blur kernel is represented as a matrix of any size. eg:
0.0625 0.125 0.0625
0.1250 0.250 0.1250
0.0625 0.125 0.0625


Morphological Operators:
Set of kernels that can achieve a variety of effects, such as reducing noise.


Gradients:
Image gradient is a directional change in the intensity or the color of an image. It is useful for edge detection in images.
