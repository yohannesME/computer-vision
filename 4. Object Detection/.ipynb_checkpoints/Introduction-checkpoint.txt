Types of Object Detection techniques:

Template Matching:
Searches for an exact copy of an image from another image

Corner Detection:
Looking for corners in images

Edge Detection:
Expanding to find general edges of objects

Grid Detection:
Combining both concepts to find grids in images (useful for applications)

Contour Detection:
Allows us to detect foreground vs background images.
Also allows for detection of external vs internal contours (e.g. grabbing the eyes and smile from a cartoon face)

Feature Matching:
More advanced method of detecting matching objects in another image, even if the target image is not shown exactly the same in the image we are searching

Watershed Algorithm:
Allows us to segment images into foreground and background.
Also allows us to manually set seeds to choose segments of an image.

Facial and Eye Detection:
Use Haar Cascades to detect faces in images
